    <title>VMware CWS Checker Error #2</title>
    <body>
           <h1>Not sure if you are behind CWS.</h1>
           <p>The extension is using <a href="http://www.ipify.org">ipify api</a> to determine your IP in the internet.</p>
           <p>In this case, the returned value by ipify was not a valid IP and hence the extension cannot determine if you are behind CWS.</p>
           <p><strong>Please try again later.</strong></p>
