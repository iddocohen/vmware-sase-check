                <li>To download and install the <strong>SSL Certification</strong>, so VMware CWS can inspect download/upload traffic.</li>
                <li>Ensure all domains in <code>js/vmchecker.config.js</code> under the variable <code>testing_domains</code> are going through VMware CWS.</li>

            <br>
            Rather then be specific on which HTTP/HTTPs traffic should or should not go through VMware CWS, I would recommend to send all traffic to VMware CWS for the duration of the testing.

                <ul>
                    <li>It checks first your external IP. This done by calling <strong>http://api.ipify.org/</strong> API.</li>
                    <li>Checking if the IP is within a VMware SASE POP definition</li>
                    <li>Tries to reach <strong>https://safe-cws-sase.vmware.com</strong> to double confirm that one is behind CWS</li>
                </ul>
            After confirming the above, it will do a <strong>performance</strong> test:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li> It will use the domains defined in the file <code>js/vmchecker.config.js</code> within the variable name <code>testing_domains</code>.</li>
                    <li> It will calculate the response time of each and calculate the total average, std and percentile statistics.</li>
                </ul>
            <br>
            One can alter the <code>test_domains</code> variable to include or exclude domains for testing. Please only note, adding more domains, will cause more load to your browser.

For example, the Vimeo test-case under CASB tries to test of if search is getting blocked and if other parts of Vimeo are still working as expectged. If URL filtering is used to block Vimeo then all the urls will not get blocked, which means, yes searching got blocked but everything else as well - which is not what was expected.</li>
                <li><strong>Unblocked</strong> it means the extension received HTTP 200 (OK). Either configuration was not applied correct or the content bypassed CWS.</li>
                <li><strong>Error</strong> it means any other response status which is not 403 or 200 has been received. This could be caused by many factors, e.g. the testing site is unreachable or another security enforcement has protected one.
