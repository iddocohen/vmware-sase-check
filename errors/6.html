    <title>VMware CWS Checker Error #6</title>
    <body>
           <h1>CWS was not reachable.</h1>
           <p>When the extension tried to call the VMware CWS url, it received an unknown status.</p>
           <p>Either VMware CWS is unreachable or a connection error occured on the client</p>
           <p><strong>Please try to re-run the test again later and ensure that all http/https traffic is going towards VMware CWS.</strong></p>
