    <title>VMware CWS Checker Error #1</title>
    <body>
           <h1>You are partially behind CWS</h1>
           <p>This warning occurs when CWS connectivity determined that your external IP does not correspond to a VMware SASE IP range but you can reach some of the CWS services.</p>
           <p>This means some of the http/https traffic go a different path and not reaching VMware CWS.</p>
           <p><strong>Please ensure that all http/https traffic goes through VMware CWS.</strong></p>
